// `Destructible` awaits multiple concurrent JavaScript `Promise`s as
// implemented by the JavaScript `Promise` class. Additionally, `Destructible`
// registers destructor functions that will cancel the `Promise`s it is
// awaiting. `Destructible` will allow you to stop all the awaited `Promise`s at
// once and return. Unlike `Promise.all`, `Destructible` will ensure that all
// the promises return when any `Promise` rejects.
//
// TODO Introduce the term "`Promise` group."
//
// When you cancel a `Destructible` it will fire all the destructor functions
// you registered to cancel all the `Promises`s you registered. You can use
// cancellation to ensure that all your `Promise`s resolve when you exit your
// application.
//
// Cancellation can also occur automatically when a `Promise` in the group
// resolves. This is done by registering the `Promise` as a durable `Promise`,
// meaning that it should run for the duration of the `Promise` group. If it
// resolve it means that the `Promise` group has finished it's task and all the
// other `Promises` should resolve shortly.
//
// You await the resolution of the collected `Promise`s in a `Destructible` by
// awaiting the resolution of the `Destructible.promise` property which itself a
// `Promise`. If one or more of the the awaited promises rejects,
// `Destructible.promise` will reject with an `Error` that collects the
// rejections as causes and reports them in a nested heirarchy with their stack
// traces so you can see all the errors that interrupted your application, not
// just the first one raised.
//
// You can group your `Promise`s by a specific application task &mdash; like
// reading and writing to an open socket &mdash; by creating
// sub-`Destructible`s. You can then cancel a sub-`Destructible` without
// cancelling it's parent.
//
// It creates a dependency tree for destructors. A root `Destructible` instance
// can be used to create sub-`Destructible` instances that will destruct when
// the root destructs. sub-`Destructible` instances can create further
// sub-`Destructible` instances and so on.
//
// `async` functions are monitored by passing their `Promise`s to either
// `Destructible.durable()` if the end of the function should indicate the end
// of the program or `Destructible.ephemeral()` if the end of the function
// should not indicate the end of the program. `Destructible.ephemeral()` acts
// as a boundary. Any sub-`Destructible`s that are durable will trigger the
// destruction of the sub-tree that is rooted at the first ancestor that is
// ephemeral or at the top most `Destructible` if none exist.
//
// For example, you can use an ephemeral `Destructible` to monitor an open
// socket and shut down all `async` functions that are participating in the
// processing of that socket. An `async` function may return because it has
// reached the end-of-stream while reading the socket and then trigger the
// shutdown of the writing end of the socket and any other functions
// participating in the processing of the socket input. It will not shutdown any
// other ephemeral trees processing other sockets.
//
// However, in this example, if you destroy the root `Destructible` it will
// trigger the shutdown of all sub-`Destructible`s thereby destroying all the
// ephemeral sub-`Destructible`s that are processing sockets.
//
// To cancel your `async` functions you register destructors using the
// `Destructible.destruct()` function. Destructors are run when you call
// `Destructible.destroy()`.
